## About The Project

Intellihome is a Python-based smart home system designed to understand and respond to your needs through voice commands, gestures, and facial recognition. Powered by Google's Gemini flash and leveraging the power of OpenCV and Mediapipe, Intellihome seamlessly integrates into your daily life, making it easier and more comfortable.

### Features

* **Natural Language Processing:** Interact with Mira, your AI assistant, using natural language to get information, set reminders, and control smart devices.
* **Gesture Recognition:** Use simple hand gestures to control various aspects of your home environment.
* **Facial Recognition:** Intellihome can recognize you and personalize settings based on your preferences.
* **OpenWeatherMap Integration:**  Get real-time weather updates for your location.
* **Continuously Learning:** Intellihome adapts and learns your habits over time to provide a personalized experience. 

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Gemini-url](https://aistudio.google.com)
* [OpenCV-url](https://opencv.org/)
* [Mediapipe-url](https://chuoling.github.io/mediapipe/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* pip (package installer for Python)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/xxlyitemxx/Mira-Intellihome.git
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Markdown

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Intellihome
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Sh

2. Install required packages:
```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Obtain API keys:

Google Gemini flash: [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com)

OpenWeatherMap: [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Configure API keys:

Create a config.json file in the project's root directory.

Add the following lines, replacing placeholders with your actual keys:
```
{
    "api_key": "Your Gemini api key!",
    "city":"Your city!"
} 
```

Usage

Run the main script:
```
python main.py
```

Start interacting with Mira using voice commands.

Examples:

  "What time is it?"
  
  "How many fingers can you see?"
  
  "What's the weather like?"
  
  "Tell me a joke."
